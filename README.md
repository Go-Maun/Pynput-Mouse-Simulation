# Pynput-Mouse-Simulation

PynputMouseMover is a simple little program that requires the pynput library to be installed, as well as the user commenting out which method they do not want to use (mouse moving in circles or mouse moving in a rectangle). 

I made this program not only so I could sleep with an idle game on in the background and make faster progression, but also so I could expand my knowledge of python and its many libraries and how to install and use them.
